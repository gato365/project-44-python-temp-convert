# Temperature Converter Tool

## Introduction
This Temperature Converter Tool is a simple Python application designed to help students learn about temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It offers an interactive way to reinforce concepts of mathematical functions and conditional logic.

## How to Use the Tool in the Classroom
- **Reinforce Math Concepts**: Use the converter to teach students about linear functions and equations in a practical context.
- **Intro to Programming**: Introduce basic programming concepts such as functions, loops, user input, and exception handling.
- **Problem-Solving**: Encourage students to think critically about the steps required to solve a problem through programming.

## Setup
1. Ensure that Python is installed on the classroom computers. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Copy the provided Python script into a text editor and save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `temperature_converter.py`.

## Running the Program
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `temperature_converter.py` file is saved.
3. Run the script by typing `python temperature_converter.py` and pressing Enter.

## Instructions for Students
1. Run the Temperature Converter Tool as directed by your teacher.
2. Choose the type of conversion you want to perform by entering `1` or `2`.
3. Enter the temperature you wish to convert when prompted.
4. Read the output and verify the conversion using a calculator or conversion chart for accuracy.

## Classroom Activities
- **Conversion Challenges**: Have students convert a series of temperatures and check their answers with the tool.
- **Understanding Code**: Review the code with the students and discuss how each part works. Modify the conversion formulas or add new features as a class exercise.
- **Real-world Application**: Discuss real-life scenarios where temperature conversion might be necessary, such as weather reporting or cooking.
